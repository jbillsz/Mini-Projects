# Mini-Projects
Some mini projects I worked on in my journey of learning the basics of Machine Learning. Basically where I store my roff works.
I hope this will set me on my way to become the greatest potential I can ever be and also a talent that the world has never seen.
Wish me luck.
Please feel free to criticize my code writing. I need to be better. Also feel free to reach out to me too.
